##Each player has their own panel which will be used to update their score.
###During play, input route lengths after building by using the "Built" buttons (1-6):
####For example: In the following picture, when you click 6 the number of trains remaining will decrease, the score will increase, and the undo information will be updated.
####Note: Ticket2Score allows you to undo most actions.

###Note: the number of trains remaining will turn red when a player has 0, 1, or 2 remaining. This indicates the final turn!

##Finally, when the gameplay has finished, Ticket2Score really shines!
###Simply go through the list, adding or subtracting destinations:
###Note: when you first open the list, you can start typing the destination to short-cut to it.

###This shows completed and uncompleted destinations, as well as bonuses.
